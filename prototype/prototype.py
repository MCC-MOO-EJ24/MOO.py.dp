"""
Prototype
- A partially or fully initialized object that you copy (clone) and make use of

Motivation
- Complicated objects (e.g., cars) aren't designed from scratch
  - They iterate exists designs
- An existing (partially or fully constructed) design is a Prototype
- We make a copy (clone) the prototype and customize it
  - Requires a 'deep copy' support
- We make the cloning convenient (e.g., via a Factory)
