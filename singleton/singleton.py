"""
Singleton
- A component which is instantiated only once

Motivation
- For some components it only makes sense to have one in the system
  - Database repository
  - Object factory
- E.g., the initializer call is expensive
  - We only do it once
  - We provide everyone with the same instance
- Want to prevent anyone from creating additional copies
- Need to take care of lazy instantiation
